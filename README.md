##  Using 
A basic SMP client, suitable for use in the PEPPOL network, can be found in /generic/src/test/java/org/holodeckb2b/bdxr/smp/example/
The client has a CLI. Before use, it must be configured for your specific setup.

* fork the repository
* create a branch (optionally with the reference to the issue in the name)
* write your code
* commit incrementally with readable and detailed commit messages
* submit a pull-request against the master branch of this repository

If your contribution is more than a patch, please contact us beforehand to discuss which branch you can best submit the pull request to.
