## Contributing
We are using the simplified Github workflow to accept modifications which means you should:
* create an issue related to the problem you want to fix or the function you want to add (good for traceability and cross-reference)
* fork the repository
* create a branch (optionally with the reference to the issue in the name)
* write your code
* commit incrementally with readable and detailed commit messages
* submit a pull-request against the master branch of this repository

If your contribution is more than a patch, please contact us beforehand to discuss which branch you can best submit the pull request to.

### Submitting bugs
You can report issues directly on the [project Issue Tracker](https://github.com/holodeck-b2b/bdxr-common/issues).
