## Contributing
We are using the simplified Github workflow to accept modifications which means you should:
* create an issue related to the problem you want to fix or the function you want to add (good for traceability and cross-reference)
* fork the repository
* create a branch (optionally with the reference to the issue in the name)
* write your code, including comments
* commit incrementally with readable and detailed commit messages
* run integration tests to check everything works on runtime
* Update the changelog with a short description of the changes including a reference to the issues fixed
* submit a pull request *against the 'next' branch* of this repository

If your contribution is more than a patch, please contact us beforehand to discuss how you can best submit the pull request.
